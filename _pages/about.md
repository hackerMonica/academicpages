    * C++, JS, and some popular languages are basically grasped, but I could only read or write some code in built framework.
* Platform: Linux
    * For building a website on a Linux server (located in German), I have much experience using Linux systems.
* Development: Back-end, PC (with Java or Godot), and common deep-learning programming

self-assessment
======
Own great ability in practice, but could have done better on curriculum exams, mainly in my first year of college. I grasp practical knowledge rapidly, while academic ones are slightly slower.

I like exercising, and I am used to running several times a week. Besides, I like using Linux systems, and I recently built my own NAS, academic page, and blog.
