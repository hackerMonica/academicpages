Skills
======
* Programming Languages: Java == Godot > C == Python == PHP > C++ == JavaScript
    * I'm experienced in Java and Godot. Besides, using C, Python, or PHP to write simple applications is also easy.
    * I could use Python (pytorch) to train some common deep-learning network
    * C++, JS, and some popular languages are basically grasped, but I could only read or write some code in built framework.
* Platform: Linux
    * For building a website on a Linux server (located in German), I have much experience using Linux systems.
* Development: Back-end, PC (with Java or Godot), and common deep-learning programming
    * I'm actually a full-stack programmer, but my JS is not experienced, so I usually build applications with the Godot engine.
* Other: Markdown and Latex writing

self-assessment
======
Own great ability in practice, but could have done better on curriculum exams, mainly in my first year of college. I grasp practical knowledge rapidly, while academic ones are slightly slower.

I like exercising, and I am used to running several times a week. Besides, I like using Linux systems, and I recently built my own NAS and [anime website](https://hackermonica.me).
