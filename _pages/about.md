	* For building website on Linux server (locating at German), I have many experience using Linux system.
* Development: Back-end, PC (with Java or Godot) and common deeplearning programming
	* I'm actually a full stack programmer, but my JS is not experienced so I build application with Godot engine usually.

self-assessment
======
Own great ability on practice, but did not well on curriculum exams mainly in my first year of college. I grasp practical knowledge rapidly while academic ones a little bit slower.

I like exercising and I am used to run several times a week. Besides, I like to use Linux system and I build my own NAS and [anime website](https://hackermonica.me) recently.
