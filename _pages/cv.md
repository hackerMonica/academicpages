	* I could use Python (pytorch) to train some common deeplearning network
	* C++, JS and some popular languages are basically grasped but I could only read or write some code in built framework.
* Platform: Linux
	* For building website on Linux server (locating at German), I have many experience using Linux system.
* Development: Back-end, PC (with Java or Godot) and common deeplearning programming
	* I'm actually a full stack programmer, but my JS is not experienced so I build application with Godot engine usually.
